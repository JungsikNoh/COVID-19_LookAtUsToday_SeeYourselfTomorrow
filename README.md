# COVID-19 Time Series: Look At Us Today, See Yourself Tomorrow

>*Look at us today, see yourself tomorrow.*  
>*- NY, Governor Andrew Cuomo*

The COVID-19 pandemic hit our entire planet hard, taking lots of lives. Most of us are under physical distancing to fight the virus together and to flatten the curve. 

To win this extraordinary war, *accurate and quick monitoring* of the infections is fundamental. A pandemic event can be monitored by the curve of cumulative confirmed cases or deaths over time. Observing such curves for COVID-19, we can see that some countries like China, Korea or Italy are at the later stage of the virus spreading, while others might be at the beginning.

Showing the ever-increasing number of new cases every day, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo sent the message on April 1, 2020. A data science pipeline presented here tries to implement exactly what Governor Cuomo said in a quantitative manner. By looking at the preceding pandemic time courses of Italy and Korea, we seek to answer how many new confirmed cases of a country or a region could be in the near future. 

*This data science pipeline will help us monitor the number of positive cases every day in comparison with Italy and Korea.* It provides straightforward visualization of COVID-19 cases to see where we are in view of the past of Italy and Korea. Since the analysis compares population-normalized numbers of daily new cases, it also allows us to compare the sizes of infection in different countries or states in the U.S.
